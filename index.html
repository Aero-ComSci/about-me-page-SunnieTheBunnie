    <p>My name is Sunnie, and I am a ninth grader in Emerald High School with many ambitions for my future. As of now, I want to pursue a job in the medical field, specifically Family Medicine. While I do enjoy Computer Science, I have thought about it and I have decided that I may be more interested in biomed instead. However, I still decided to take Computer Science for the first year so I have some knowledge about coding and technology which very well may be crucial in the medical field. This being said, I plan to take biomed for the rest of my high school years. Once I graduate, I plan on going to a good college and earn a doctorate degree after that. This is my choice because I am more fascinated by biomed and I want to help others in the future.
    <p>As for my personal qualities, I am an ambitious and thorough person which attributes to the fact that these qualities are highly valued in my career goal. Currently, I have multiple extracurricular activites suc as badminton and piano. I have played piano since kindergarten and through the years, I have done many performances and have also tested for a level test, level 8. Next year, I plan on testing for level 10 which is the highest level. These years have taught me to be very strong and ambitious and continue what I am doing. With this, playing piano also involves being thorough in order to ensure that no mistakes are made. This is how I got these qualities. Extracurriculars are not the only experiences in which I have learned more about myself. In school, I tend to work well with others and have a good sense of communication within a group. This has taught me that I work better with others, rather than alone.</p>
    <p>While this is my very first year in high school, I have already made some achievements. Since this high school is new, I wanted to have a better experience by making new friends in every class. This has greatly improved my experience in every class as I can have people to talk with. I am also planning on trying out for sport teams, such as badminton, which is coming up pretty soon. In addition, this new opportunity in high school also brings new clubs, which I did join a few. These clubs provide a better connection with what is happening in the school.</p>
    <p>All in all, I think that the next few years will be great for me and I will be able to make new and better experiences. I hope to improve my qualities and expand my knowledge on fields in which I am interested in. I really appreciate the time you took to read my About Me page and I hope you enjoy my site. There are so many things to explore on my site just like the opportunities life provides. Thank you!</p>
